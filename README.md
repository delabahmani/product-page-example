# E-commerce Product Page Clone (frontendmentor.io)

Decided to try out a bit more of a challenge. Struggled heavily with the SVGs, especially when it came to responsiveness and hover effects. I wish I organized my styling a bit more, as I was too focused on trying to duplicate it as much as possible.
